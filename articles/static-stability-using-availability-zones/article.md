Introduction
At Amazon, the services we build must meet extremely high availability targets. This means that
we need to think carefully about the dependencies that our systems take. We design our systems
to stay resilient even when those dependencies are impaired. In this article, we’ll define a pattern
that we use called static stability to achieve this level of resilience. We’ll show you how we apply
this concept to Availability Zones, a key infrastructure building block in AWS and therefore a
bedrock dependency on which all of our services are built.
In a statically stable design, the overall system keeps working even when a dependency becomes
impaired. Perhaps the system doesn’t see any updated information (such as new things, deleted
things, or modified things) that its dependency was supposed to have delivered. However,
everything it was doing before the dependency became impaired continues to work despite the
impaired dependency. We’ll describe how we built Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) to be
statically stable. Then we’ll provide two statically stable example architectures we've found useful
for building highly available regional systems on top of Availability Zones.
Finally, we’ll go deeper into some of the design philosophy behind Amazon EC2 including how it’s

Static Stability Using Availability Zones

Services such as Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS), and Amazon Simple
Storage Service (S3) are examples of such regional services.
When interacting with an AWS service that provisions cloud infrastructure inside of an Amazon
Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), many of these services require the caller to specify not only a Region
but also an Availability Zone. The Availability Zone is often specified implicitly in a required subnet
argument, for example when launching an EC2 instance, provisioning an Amazon Relational
Database Service (RDS) database, or creating an Amazon ElastiCache cluster. Although it’s
common to have multiple subnets in an Availability Zone, a single subnet lives entirely within a
The Amazon Builders' Library
single Availability Zone, and so by providing a subnet argument, the caller is also implicitly
providing an Availability Zone to use.

Static stability
When building systems on top of Availability Zones, one lesson we have learned is to be ready for
impairments before they happen. A less effective approach might be to deploy to multiple
Availability Zones with the expectation that, should there be an impairment within one
Availability Zone, the service will scale up (perhaps using AWS Auto Scaling) in other Availability
Zones and be restored to full health. This approach is less effective because it relies on reacting to
impairments as they happen, rather than being prepared for those impairments before they
happen. In other words, it lacks static stability. In contrast, a more effective, statically stable
service would overprovision its infrastructure to the point where it would continue operating
correctly without having to launch any new EC2 instances, even if an Availability Zone were to
become impaired.
To better illustrate the property of static stability, let's look at Amazon EC2, which is itself
designed according to those principles.
The Amazon EC2 service consists of a control plane and a data plane. “Control plane” and “data
plane” are terms of art from networking, but we use them all over the place within AWS. A control
plane is the machinery involved in making changes to a system—adding resources, deleting
resources, modifying resources—and getting those changes propagated to wherever they need to
go to take effect. A data plane, in contrast, is the daily business of those resources, that is, what it

It propagates the needed configurations to the server in the VPC and the network edge as
appropriate.
In contrast, the Amazon EC2 data plane keeps existing EC2 instances humming along as expected,
performing tasks such as these:
It routes packets according to the VPC's route tables.
It reads and writes from Amazon EBS volumes.
AndAmazon
so on.
The
Builders' Library
As is usually the case with data planes and control planes, the Amazon EC2 data plane is far
simpler than its control plane. As a result of its relative simplicity, the Amazon EC2 data plane's
design targets a higher availability than that of the Amazon EC2 control plane.
Importantly, the Amazon EC2 data plane has been carefully designed to be statically stable in the
face of control plane availability events (such as impairments in the ability to launch EC2
instances). For example, to avoid disruptions in network connectivity, the Amazon EC2 data plane
is designed so that the physical machine on which an EC2 instance runs has local access to all of
the information it needs to route packets to points inside and outside of its VPC. An impairment of
the Amazon EC2 control plane means that during the event the physical server might not see
updates like a new EC2 instance added to a VPC, or a new Security Group rule. However, the traffic
it had been able to send and receive before the event will continue to work.
The concepts of control planes, data planes, and static stability are broadly applicable, even
beyond Amazon EC2. Being able to decompose a system into its control plane and data plane can
be a helpful conceptual tool for designing highly available services, for a number of reasons:
It's typical for the availability of the data plane to be even more critical to the success of the
customers of a service than the control plane. For example, the continued availability and
correct functioning of an EC2 instance, after it is running, is even more important to most AWS
customers than the ability to launch new EC2 instances.
It's typical for the data plane to operate at a higher volume (often by orders of magnitude)
than its control plane. Thus, it's better to keep them separate so that each can be scaled
according to its own relevant scaling dimensions.
We’ve found over the years that a system's control plane tends to have more moving parts
than itsyour
data plane,
so it's statistically
more likely to become impaired for that reason alone.

Earlier we noted that a scheme that requires the replacement of an EC2 instance in response to an
Availability Zone impairment is a less effective approach. It’s not because we won’t be able to
launch the new EC2 instance. It’s because in response to an impairment the system has to take an
immediate dependency for the recovery path on the Amazon EC2 control plane, plus all of the

https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/static-stability-using-availability-zones/

application-specific systems that are necessary for a new instance to start performing useful work.
Depending on the application, these dependencies could include steps such as downloading
runtime configuration, registering the instance with discovery services, acquiring credentials, etc.
The control plane systems are necessarily more complex than those in the data plane, and they
have a greater chance of not behaving correctly when the overall system is impaired.

Static

patterns
The Amazon
Builders'
Library
In this section, we’ll introduce two high-level patterns that we use in AWS to design systems for
high availability by leveraging static stability. Each is applicable to its own set of situations, but
both take advantage of the Availability Zone abstraction.
Active-active on Availability Zones example: A load-balanced service
Several AWS services are internally composed of a horizontally scalable, stateless fleet of EC2
instances or Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) containers. We run these services in an Auto
Scaling group across three or more Availability Zones. Additionally, these services overprovision
capacity so that, even if an entire Availability Zone were impaired, the servers in the remaining
Availability Zones could carry the load. For example, when we use three Availability Zones, we
overprovision by 50 percent. Put another way, we overprovision such that each Availability Zone is
operating at only 66 percent of the level for which we have load-tested it.
The most common example is a load balanced HTTPS service. The following diagram shows a
public-facing Application Load Balancer providing an HTTPS service. The target of the load
balancer is an Auto Scaling group that spans the three Availability Zones in the eu-west-1 Region.
This is an example of active-active high availability using Availability Zones.

Static Stability Using Availability Zones

In the event of an Availability Zone impairment, the architecture shown in the preceding diagram
requires no action. The EC2 instances in the impaired Availability Zone will start failing health
checks, and the Application Load Balancer will shift traffic away from them. In fact, the Elastic
Load Balancing service is designed according to this principle. It has provisioned enough loadbalancing capacity to withstand an Availability Zone impairment without needing to scale up.
We also use this pattern even when there is no load balancer or HTTPS service. For example, a
fleet of EC2 instances that processes messages from an Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
queue can follow this pattern too. The instances are deployed in an Auto Scaling group across
The Amazon Builders' Library
multiple Availability Zones, appropriately overprovisioned. In the event of an impaired Availability
Zone, the service does nothing. The impaired instances stop doing their work, and others pick up
the slack.
Active-standby on Availability Zones example: A relational database
Some of the services we build are stateful and require a single primary or leader node to
coordinate the work. An example of this is a service that uses a relational database, such as
Amazon RDS with a MySQL or Postgres database engine. A typical high-availability setup for this
kind of relational database has a primary instance, which is the one to which all writes must go,
and a standby candidate. We also might have additional read replicas, which are not shown in the
following diagram. When we work with stateful infrastructure like this, there will be a warm
standby node in a different Availability Zone from that of the primary node.
The following diagram shows an Amazon RDS database. When we provision a database with
Amazon RDS, it requires a subnet group. A subnet group is a set of subnets spanning multiple
Availability Zones into which the database instances will be provisioned. Amazon RDS puts the
standby candidate in a different Availability Zone from the primary node. This is an example of
active-standby high availability using Availability Zones.

As was the case with the stateless, active-active example, when the Availability Zone with the
primary node becomes impaired, the stateful service does nothing with the infrastructure. For
services that use Amazon RDS, RDS will manage the failover and repoint the DNS name to the

new primary in the working Availability Zone. This pattern also applies to other active-standby
setups, even if they do not use a relational database. In particular, we apply this to systems with a
cluster architecture that has a leader node. We deploy these clusters across Availability Zones and
elect the new leader node from a standby candidate instead of launching a replacement “just in
time.”
What these two patterns have in common is that both of them had already provisioned the
capacity they’d need in the event of an Availability Zone impairment well in advance of any actual
impairment. In neither of these cases is the service taking any deliberate control plane

dependencies, such as provisioning new infrastructure or making modifications, in response to an
Availability Zone impairment.

Under the hood: Static stability inside of Amazon EC2
This final section of the article will go one level deeper into resilient Availability Zone
architectures, covering some of the ways in which we follow the Availability Zone independence
principle in Amazon EC2. Understanding some of these concepts is helpful when we build a service
that not only needs to be highly available itself, but also needs to provide infrastructure on which
others can be highly available. Amazon EC2, as a provider of low-level AWS infrastructure, is the
infrastructure that applications can use to be highly available. There are times when other systems
might wish to adopt that strategy as well.
We follow the Availability Zone independence principle in Amazon EC2 in our deployment
practices. In Amazon EC2, software is deployed to the physical servers hosting EC2 instances, edge
devices, DNS resolvers, control plane components in the EC2 instance launch path, and many
other components upon which EC2 instances depend. These deployments follow a zonal
deployment calendar. This means that two Availability Zones in the same Region will receive a
given deployment on different days. Across AWS, we use a phased rollout of deployments. For
example, we follow the best practice (regardless of the type of service to which we deploy) of first
deploying a one-box, and then 1/N of servers, etc. However, in the specific case of services like
those in Amazon EC2, our deployments go one step further and are deliberately aligned to the
Availability Zone boundary. That way, a problem with a deployment affects one Availability Zone

services is fronted by an Application Load Balancer, and each service has a well-provisioned fleet
of backend hosts spread across three Availability Zones. One highly available regional service calls
another highly available regional service. This is a simple design, and for many of the services
we’ve built, it's a good design.

The Amazon Builders' Library

Suppose, however, that the green service is a foundational service. That is, suppose it is intended
not only to be highly available but also, itself, to serve as a building block for providing
Availability Zone independence. In that case, we might instead design it as three instances of a
zone-local service, on which we follow Availability Zone-aware deployment practices. The
following diagram illustrates the design in which a highly available regional service calls a highly
available zonal service.

Static Stability Using Availability Zones

The reasons why we design our building-block services to be Availability Zone independent come
down to simple arithmetic. Let’s say an Availability Zone is impaired. For black and white failures,
the Application Load Balancer will automatically fail away from the affected nodes. However, not
all failures are so obvious. There can be gray failures, such as bugs in the software, which the load
balancer won’t be able to see in its health check and cleanly handle.
In the earlier example, where one highly available regional service calls another highly available
regional service, if a request is sent through the system, then with some simplifying assumptions,
the chance of the request avoiding the impaired Availability Zone is 2/3 * 2/3 = 4/9. That is, the
The Amazon Builders' Library
request has worse than even odds of steering clear of the event. In contrast, if we built the green
service to be a zonal service as in the current example, then the hosts in the orange service can
call the green endpoint in the same Availability Zone. With this architecture, the chances of
avoiding the impaired Availability Zone are 2/3. If N services are a part of this call path, then these
numbers generalize to (2/3)^N for N regional services versus remaining constant at 2/3 for N
zonal services.
It is for this reason that we built Amazon EC2 NAT gateway as a zonal service. NAT gateway is an
Amazon EC2 feature that allows for outbound internet traffic from a private subnet and appears
not as a regional, VPC-wide gateway but as a zonal resource, that customers instantiate separately
per Availability Zone as shown in the following diagram. The NAT gateway sits in the path of
internet connectivity for the VPC, and it is therefore part of the data plane of any EC2 instance
within that VPC. If there is a connectivity impairment in one Availability Zone, we want to keep
that impairment inside that Availability Zone, rather than spreading it to other zones. In the end,
we want a customer who built an architecture similar to that mentioned earlier in this article (that
is, by provisioning a fleet across three Availability Zones with enough capacity in any two to carry
the full load) to know that the other Availability Zones will be completely unaffected by anything
going on in the impaired Availability Zone. The only way for us to do this is to ensure that all
foundational components—like the NAT gateway—really do stay within the Availability Zone.

This choice comes with the cost of additional complexity. For us in Amazon EC2, the additional
complexity comes in the form of managing zonal, rather than regional, service environments. For

https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/static-stability-using-availability-zones/

customers of NAT gateway, the additional complexity comes in the form of having multiple NAT
gateways and route tables, for use in the different Availability Zones of the VPC. The additional
complexity is appropriate because NAT gateway is itself a foundational service, part of the
Amazon EC2 data plane that is supposed to provide zonal availability guarantees.
There’s one more consideration we make when building services that are Availability Zone
independent, and that is data durability. Although each of the zonal architectures described
earlier shows the entire stack contained within a single Availability Zone, we replicate any hard
state across multiple Availability Zones for disaster recovery purposes. For example, we typically
The Amazon Builders' Library
store periodic database backups in Amazon S3 and maintain read replicas of our data stores across
Availability Zone boundaries. These replicas aren't necessary for the primary Availability Zone to
function. Instead, they ensure that we store customer- or business-critical data in multiple
locations.
When designing a service-oriented architecture that will run in AWS, we have learned to use one
of these two patterns, or a combination of both:
The simpler pattern: regional-calls-regional. This is often the best choice for external-facing
services, and appropriate for most internal services as well. For example, when building
higher-level application services in AWS, such as Amazon API Gateway and AWS serverless
technologies, we use this pattern to provide high availability even in the face of Availability
Zone impairments.
The more complex pattern: regional-calls-zonal or zonal-calls-zonal. When designing internal,
and in some cases external, data plane components within Amazon EC2 (for example, network
appliances or other infrastructure that sits directly in the critical data path) we follow the
pattern of Availability Zone independence and use instances that are siloed in Availability
Zones, so that network traffic remains in its same Availability Zone. This pattern not only helps
keep impairments isolated to an Availability Zone but also has favorable network traffic cost
characteristics in AWS.
